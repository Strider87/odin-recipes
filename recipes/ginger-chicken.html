<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Chicken Meatballs:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced</li>
    <li>1/2 onion, finely minced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon light soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sake</li>
    <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>1/4 cup sliced green onions</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sauce:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 teaspoons light soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dark soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon oyster sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 teaspoon sesame seed</li>
    <li>2 cups chopped mixed stir-fry vegetables, such as red bell pepper, carrots, snow peas, broccoli, and onions, or more to taste</li>
    <li>2 cups cooked jasmine rice</li>
</ul>


<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <strong><li>Step 1</li></strong>
    <p>
        Combine ground chicken, garlic, ginger, onion, 1 tablespoon light soy sauce, sake, egg, panko, and green onions in a bowl. Gently mix and form into 1-inch meatballs. Place shaped meatballs onto a parchment lined tray. 
    </p>

    <strong><li>Step 2</li></strong>
    <p>
        For sauce, whisk together 2 teaspoons light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, honey, oyster sauce, water, and cornstarch in a bowl; set aside.
    </p>

    <strong><li>Step 3</li></strong>
    <p>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Using a spider or slotted spoon, carefully lower chicken meatballs into boiling water - you may have to do this in batches. Cook until meatballs float to the top, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove meatballs with a spider or slotted spoon.
    </p>

    <strong><li>Step 4</li></strong>
    <p>
        Heat sesame oil in a wok. Add chicken meatballs, and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Pour sauce ingredients into the wok. Add the mixed vegetables, toss to mix. Cook until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.
    </p>

    <strong><li>Step 5</li></strong>
    <p>
        Place 1/2 cup cooked jasmine rice in each bowl or on each plate. Add cooked vegetables and chicken meatballs. Serve immediately.
