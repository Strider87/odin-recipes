<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    These subtle tarragon-flavored light and moist turkey burgers use Rice Krispies instead of bread crumbs to hold them together. 
    We enjoy them with mayo, tomato, fried onion, and lettuce on a sesame seed bun.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
    <li>1/3 cup crispy rice cereal, such as Rice Krispies</li>
    <li>1/4 cup shredded zucchini</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons finely minced red onion</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried tarragon</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <strong><li>Step 1</li></strong>
    <p>
        Combine turkey, Rice Krispies, zucchini, onion, Dijon, tarragon, garlic salt, and black pepper in a bowl. 
        Gently mix with a fork or your hands until just combined.
    </p>

    <strong><li>Step 2</li></strong>
    <p>
        Divide the meat into 4 equal portions, shape into patties, and move to the freezer for 20 minutes.
    </p>

    <strong><li>Step 3</li></strong>
    <p>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium high heat, and lightly oil the grate. 
        Remove burgers from the freezer, and place on the grill. 
        Cook over direct heat until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 4 to 5 minutes per side. 
        An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center of burgers should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
    </p>

    <strong><li>Step 4</li></strong>
    <p>
        Place the turkey burgers on the buns, add toppings as desired, and serve.
